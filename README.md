A deep learning chatbot was developed using TensorFlow/Keras, achieving high accuracy in intent classification through NLP techniques like tokenization, text preprocessing, and sequence padding.  LSTM layers within a sequential model architecture captured contextual information in user input, while label encoding transformed intent tags into numerical representations for training. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.  A user-interactive interface allows response generation based on predicted intent, and the trained model, tokenizer, and label encoder are saved for future use.
